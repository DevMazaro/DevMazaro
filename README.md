## Sample Technical Projects
*These projects showcase technical capabilities and analytical approaches across various domains.*

### Machine Learning & Data Science
* [**Loan Default Prediction System**](https://github.com/DevMazaro/loan-default-prediction): A machine learning approach to predict loan default probability with risk scoring mechanisms for financial applications
* [**Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis**](https://github.com/DevMazaro/mall-customer-segmentation): Comprehensive customer segmentation using multiple clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) with actionable business insights

## Start from the middle series (In the works)
  Series of projects covering machine learning concepts, with the following steps:
  * Overview of algorithm concepts, uses, trade-offs.
  * Real world implementation using a popular library.
  * Basic implementation from scratch.
  * Performance comparison with the ML library.  
  
  This aims to give readers the best of both worlds by anchoring solid concepts to real world scenarios, and a deep dive on implementation details.
