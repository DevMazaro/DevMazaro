### About Me

I am a senior technology leader with over 20 years of experience architecting and delivering high-impact data, AI, and ML solutions for companies like **Warner Bros.**, **Dell**, and **The Walt Disney Company**. My expertise is in translating complex business needs into robust and scalable technical realities.

Throughout my career, I have led technical teams and architected systems that delivered a **$4M reduction in total cost of ownership**, rescued a failing data platform by **reducing its timeline by 75%**, and **improved deployment process efficiency by 99%**. I have deep experience with enterprise-scale data architecture, including systems processing over 5TB of daily analytics data into a Redshift data warehouse.

To continue driving innovation at the intersection of technology and business strategy, I am currently pursuing a **Master's in Computer Science** with a specialization in **Data Science** from the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. The projects on this page reflect my focus on applying advanced machine learning and data science principles to solve critical challenges.

## Sample Technical Projects
*These projects showcase technical capabilities and analytical approaches across various domains.*

### Machine Learning & Data Science
* [**eBay Laptop Price Prediction**](https://github.com/DevMazaro/eBayPricePrediction)(In Progress): ML pipeline for predicting laptop resale prices using real-world eBay data. Demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, and neural network implementation for reverse logistics applications
* [**Loan Default Prediction System**](https://github.com/DevMazaro/loan-default-prediction): A machine learning approach to predict loan default probability with risk scoring mechanisms for financial applications
* [**Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis**](https://github.com/DevMazaro/mall-customer-segmentation): Comprehensive customer segmentation using multiple clustering techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) with actionable business insights


### Data Visualization & Business Intelligence
* [**Cybersecurity Vulnerability Analysis Dashboard**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eduardo.mazaro/viz/security_dashboard/VulnerabilityAnalysisDashboard): Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing CVE vulnerability trends over time, combining MITRE and Kaggle data sources with advanced filtering and brushing capabilities for cybersecurity insights

## Start from the middle series (In the works)
  Series of projects covering machine learning concepts, with the following steps:
  * Overview of algorithm concepts, uses, trade-offs.
  * Real world implementation using a popular library.
  * Basic implementation from scratch.
  * Performance comparison with the ML library.  
  
  This aims to give readers the best of both worlds by anchoring solid concepts to real world scenarios, and a deep dive on implementation details.
